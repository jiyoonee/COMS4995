<h1>Developer Documentation</h1>
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
<p>Visualize-Spotify's codebase is largely divided into two directories named <code>auth-server</code> and <code>client</code> for the authentication server and client interface, respectively. The original code for <code>auth-server</code> can be found in <a href="https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples">this open-source repository</a>. Modifications were made to <code>authorization_code/app.js</code> as follows and are subject to more modifications based on necessary permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri for the app that was created at <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify for Developers</a>.</li>
<li>Added permissions to the scope variable.</li>
<li>Modified the redirect url following authentication to be the client interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page components should be in <code>src/components</code> directory along with their CSS stylesheets.</p>
<h2>CI Documentation</h2>
<p>Visualize-Spotify uses Travis-CI test builds. The configuration file can be found in the <code>.travis.yml</code> file. Before install, it navigates to the client folder and runs the following scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>yarn lint
<ul>
<li>This runs ESLint on the <code>client/src</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>yarn build
<ul>
<li>This creates a production build to ensure that it builds without error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>yarn test
<ul>
<li>Testing creates a code coverage report using Codecov in conjunction with running tests found in the <code>client/src/tests</code> directory. To update coverage reports in real-time, coverage tests are conducted by passing in a Codecov token as such: <code>./node_modules/.bin/codecov --token='73defb26-5b47-42ca-9b9c-62a9c2c47fda</code>. This can be found in the <code>package.json</code> file. Moreover, it ignores <code>src/ServiceWorker.js</code> and <code>src/index.js</code> because they are either not used or serve trivial purpose. The configuration file for this can be found in <code>client/jest.config.json</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>yarn doc
<ul>
<li>This updates the documentation using JSDoc3 by following the configuration file <code>jsdoc.config.json</code> found in the root directory. As can be found in <code>package.json</code>, the home page uses <code>README.md</code> found in the root directory. The documentation is hosted using GitHub Pages and can be found <a href="https://jiyoonee.github.io/VisualizeSpotify/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions and Integration authors</h2>
<p>There are currently no extensions or integration authors.</p>
<h2>Release Notes and Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Version 0.1.0 has been released and includes a landing page with authentication. Upon authentication, the application redirects to an interface where users can check the current song on play. The Spotify Web API has been hooked up.</li>
<li>Next releases will focus on fetching track analytics and implementing the recommendation system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API Documentation</h2>
<p>Visualize-Spotify uses the Spotify Web API, whose detailed documentation can be found <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">here</a>.
